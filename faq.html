        			I can honestly say that every client has unique needs so every project is a bit different. However, they do have a lot in common too, such as they almost all want or need a new website or updates and enhancements to their current systems. Most are for small businesses and efficiencies in the realm of time and money savings are of utmost importance to our clients.

        				There is an initial correspondance where I send out information so that the prospect can understand the process, the scope of work, the terms, and types of websites I develop. Then, there is an initial meeting, either in-person or via Skype where we get to know one another and talk about their business objectives. My intention is to understand what problems they need to solve. I tell them about the possibilities. Once they formally engage with me, we establish a timeline and the project begins. There is a time of discovery where we delve into their specific problems and requirements. A stage of iterative development follows along with procurement of any required hardware or hosting services. Testing the system is also an iterative process that occurs almost simultaneously. Once a module is tested, it is implemented on the staging server. When all modules are ready, the staging server becomes a site for a system test. Several cycles of testing occur before the final production-ready system is prepared and implemented.
